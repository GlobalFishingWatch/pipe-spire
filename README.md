# pipe-spire

# Introduction

This repository contains the Spire queries and its aim is to normalizes the position messages that comes from Spire.

# Development

## Dependencies

You just need [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) in your machine to run the pipeline. No other dependency is required.

### Setup

The pipeline connects to various services from Google Cloud, so you need to first authenticate with your google cloud account inside the docker images. To do that, you need to run this command and follow the instructions:

```
docker-compose run pipeline gcloud auth application-default login
```

You also need to setup your Google Cloud default project to bill for those services via this command:

```
docker-compose run pipeline gcloud config set project [YOUR PROJECT]
```

### Tests

There are [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) tests in the `tests` directory, which can be run via `docker-compose run --entrypoint pytest pipeline`.
